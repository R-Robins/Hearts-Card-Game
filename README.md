## Introduction
This is a real-time, multiplayer, online application to play the popular card game of Hearts. The game supports 2 and 4 player game rooms.

## Features

- Registration (with encrypted passwords)
- Login / Logout (with sessions)
- Lobby page: contains a lobby chat, list of current games, options to create a game, join an already made game that is not full, observe a game, and rejoin a game.
- One player can be in multiple simultaneous games at a time and there are an unlimited number of observers.
- Game rooms have their own dedicated game chats.
- Game state is persisted in the database. If a user closes a tab, and reconnects to the game, the game will be reloaded for that user.
- Game state is updated in real time in response to user events and interaction with the game using websockets.
- All the logic of the standard hearts game has been implemented and tested.
- Game rooms also contain a nudge button that will end the game on a 30 second timer if no action is taken by an opposing player.
